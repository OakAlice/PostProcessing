# Post-Processing
In animal accelerometer-based behavioural classification research, the majority of the attention has (understandably) been placed on the collection of the data and the building of the models with relatively little attention given to what to do with the data once we have it. In this chapter I am going to experiment with different post-processing workflows to find a helpful protcol for managing the predictions resulting from accelerometers.
