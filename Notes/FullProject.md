- 20/06: Sourcing data from the BEBE paper (which, by the way, is amazing -> https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-024-00511-8#Sec2). I am going to use this data for the full study. I downloaded all the "formatted" data from the zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/records/7947104
	- wtf are they in such weird formats?? This isn't half as user friendly as they claim it is
	- All the data are stored as 'clips' - does that refer to videos?
	- Looks like they have removed 'Time'... which means I have limited ability to discern true transitions... in all cases where I can get the raw data with Time, I should do that.
	- Therefore, for some of the datasets I went back to the original papers and extracted the original data instead.
	- I set up Vehkaoja_Dog and Ladds_Seal to run for ages.
- 22/06: It is now Sunday evening and I have processed features for the two named datasets and now will build a basic ML model for each of them.
	- ==I will definitely need some kind of report looking at the "realisticness" of the training data. Potentially I could look at how much of the data occurred in sequence and then have another metric of how many transitions were represented? I think this will be an important co-variable.==
- 23/06: Breathe it out breathe it out breathe it out. Trying not to have a panic attack about amberley. Hyperfocus on work?
	- I started tuning the model for the dogs and for some reason it sucks? I've stopped it and having a go on a subset of data until I find if there's a bug here?
	- Something is definitely wrong, the performance is so low... I need to step inside the parameters and see where the error is.
