## Data and Set Up
#### 28052025
- For this trial I will be using the data from the Koala project that I worked on for Gabby. In the [[ProjectPitch]] I said I would use the test data that came out of the ML model building. Using the prediction outcomes is more interesting, but without ground-truthing, I can't easily say which of them is a performance improvement.
	- Therefore, I will re-run the predictions on the test data from the koala project...
	- Okay, have done that now. Now I'm going to calculate performance (this will be a standardised method that all of them use)
	- Did the no smoothing condition, setting up the very basic code for performance checking and visualisation (essentially directly ripped from the gabby analysis). 
**Tasks for tonight or tomorrow:**
- [ ] Visualisation of sequence order
- [ ] Begin Basic Temporal Smoothing code to compare to it
