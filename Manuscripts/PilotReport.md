# Refining Machine Learning Outputs With Time-Series Based Post-Processing: Accelerometer-Based Animal Behaviour Classifications

## Introduction
Machine learning models can be trained to infer specific fine-scale behaviours from animal-borne accelerometers. This method has been implemented across hundreds of species but, despite ever-increasing sophistication of model design, performance of the behavioural classifier models retains some significant limitations. Robustly validated models indicate that individual behaviours differ in their predictability, with cyclical stable behaviours obtaining high performance but rare, context-specific, and chaotic behaviours always struggling to be predicted. Much of the field’s recent effort has focused on optimising models to increase performance on these difficult behaviours to obtain higher performance — fine-tuning algorithms, adding sensor axes, or experimenting with novel features. While each of these steps will benefit analysis, there may be simpler, more parsimonious gains to be made from the data we already have.

Current analytical pipelines often treat predicted behavioural labels as discrete categories when in fact they are probabilistic predictions. There is a misalignment between the probabilistic nature of ML outputs and the deterministic way they are interpreted. 

In other domains of machine learning, it is standard practice to address this uncertainty through post-processing. Post-processing is a secondary application of domain-specific rules or statistical corrections to refine, or "smooth" the raw predictions. For example, post-processing is used in speech recognition to enforce syntactic plausibility, in computer vision to correct improbable object detections, and in medical diagnostics to align predicted symptoms with known disease progressions. These fields acknowledge that prediction is just one step in a longer interpretive process.

In contrast, post-processing remains largely absent from animal accelerometry pipelines. Few studies attempt to correct or refine model outputs after prediction, and even fewer incorporate ecological knowledge into this stage. Yet ecologists possess a wealth of information that could inform such post-processing. For example, knowledge about the minimum duration of a behaviour could allow implausibly brief events to be eliminated, or knowledge of logical behavioural sequences could be used to eliminate implausable sequences. By integrating this knowledge into post-prediction workflows, we could correct misclassifications, fill gaps, and improve the ecological plausibility of behavioural timelines without needing perfect accuracy from the classification model itself.

In this paper, we argue that post-processing represents a critical and underused stage in the interpretation of accelerometer-derived behavioural classifications. We demonstrate how sequence and ecologically informed post-processing can improve the consistency and ecological validity of behaviour predictions, even when the original raw classification accuracy was imperfect. This approach offers a pragmatic and simple path to increase interpretibiluty of behaviour predictions while decreasing the burden to obtain perfect prediction in the ML stage.

## Methods
For this pilot study, a single dataset was used. Data was sourced from Sparkes et al., unpublished, a koala dataset containing labelled data from 10 individual koalas containing 10 distinct behaviours. Training data contained ground-truthed behavioural labels while the test data contained both the ground-truthed classes as well as predicted classes produced by a simple machine learning model in previous research [stuff I did ages ago and will be a separate paper]. 

Seven post-processing methods were compared to the control (no post-processing) predictions.

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| None (Control) | No post-processing was applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Mode           | A rolling window of five consecutive predictions was applied. The central prediction in each window was replaced with the modal (most frequent) behaviour within the window, smoothing out local misclassifications.                                                                                                     |
| Duration       | The 95th percentile of the minimum observed duration for each behaviour was calculated from the ground-truthed training data. In the test data, any predicted sequence shorter than this threshold was coerced to the preceding behaviour to eliminate implausibly brief events.                                         |
| Confusion      | A confusion matrix was derived from the test set to estimate the probability of misclassification between each pair of behaviours. At every predicted transition, if the likelihood of the new class being a misclassification of the preceding class exceeded 50%, the prediction was reassigned to the previous class. |
| Transition     | A transition probability matrix was calculated from the training data, capturing the likelihood of one behaviour transitioning to another. In the test data, transitions with less than 50% probability were considered biologically implausible and corrected by reverting the transition to the preceding behaviour.   |
| HMM            | A Hidden Markov Model was trained on the ground-truthed training data and used to post-process the predicted behavioural sequences, correcting local misclassifications based on the most likely underlying state sequence inferred by the model.                                                                        |
| Bayesian       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| LSTM           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
For each method, performance was assessed by calculating both class-specific as well as macro-averaged Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The model with the greatest increase in performance over the Control was considered the optimal method.

Additionally, to assess the impact of these post-processing changes on the overall ecological interpretations, a simple ecological question was devised for each dataset, and the same ecological analysis conducted on each of post-processed predictions. Results were compared to the ground-truthed values.

In the case of the koala data, the ecological test question was to determine the number and average duration of sleeping bouts the koala engages in where a 'bout' was defined as a continuous sequence of the same behaviour.


## Discussion
By incorporating higher-level inference, and bringing in the sequential element of timeseries data, we could achieve high performance without needing perfect classification accuracy at the level of individual seconds. In many ecological studies, the goal is not to capture moment-to-moment activity with precision anyway, but to uncover coarse-scale patterns. These questions are often robust to local classification noise and may not require high-fidelity prediction at the finest temporal scale as long as the general trends represent the underlying ecological patterns.
