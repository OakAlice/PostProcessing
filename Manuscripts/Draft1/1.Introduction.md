Machine learning models can be trained to detect specific fine-scale behaviours from animal-borne accelerometers. Despite growing sophistication in model design, however, even the best behavioural models face some fundamental constraints. Gaps in field data mean some behaviours cannot be included, while others (due to rarity, context dependence, or high variability) are difficult to classify with confidence, and performance nearly always declines across individuals and new deployment environments. Thus, while the majority of methods research has focused on improving model performance through algorithm tuning, additional sensor axes, or novel feature sets, it is improbable that perfect classification will ever be achieved. Given the inevitability of imperfect classification, therefore, ecologists are well-served considering techniques for managing and interpreting this residual error.

In the current accepted accelerometer analysis methods, the classified behavioural labels are treated as definitive categories, rather than the probabilistic predictions they actually are. In other areas of machine learning, it is standard practice to manage this uncertainty through post-processing. Post-processing is all forms of secondary inference that refines model prediction. Typically this involves applying contextual knowledge and domain-specific constraints via additional models or rule-based logic to adjust or smooth the machine learning outputs, allowing initial misclassifications to be corrected. This approach is routinely implemented across a range of fields. In speech recognition, for example, grammar rules are used to flag and correct implausible word sequences; in computer vision, unlikely object detections are filtered based on environment context; and in medical diagnostics, predictions are aligned with known symptomâ€“disease relationships to limit implausible and misleading diagnoses. In these cases, the ML model prediction is seen as only one step in a broader interpretive process.

In contrast, post-processing remains largely absent from animal accelerometry pipelines. Few studies attempt to correct or refine model outputs after prediction, and even fewer incorporate ecological knowledge into this stage. Ecologists possess domain-specific knowledge specific to the context and study species that could be used to inform such post-processing and ensure ecological reliability. For example, knowledge about the realistic minimum duration of a behaviour could allow implausibly brief events to be flagged and corrected, while a knowledge of logically acceptable behavioural sequences (walk, run) could be used to eliminate implausible sequences (lay, run). By integrating this knowledge into post-prediction workflows, we could correct misclassifications, fill gaps, and improve the ecological plausibility of behavioural classifications without needing perfect accuracy from the classification model itself.

***Figure 1.** Post-processing. Models have known error (calculated by comparing to ground-truth classes). The predictions from models onto unknown data will have this known error, as well as additional unknown error. We can use the known error information to create a secondary smoother (post-processor) that can eliminate the known error from the predictions. While this will not remove the unknown error, it is nevertheless a reduction in error.*

In this paper, we argue that post-processing represents a critical and underutilised stage in the interpretation of accelerometer-derived behavioural classifications with potential as a pragmatic and simple path to increase interpretability of behaviour predictions while decreasing the burden to obtain perfect prediction in the ML stage. We hypothesise that post-processing can improve the consistency and ecological validity of behaviour predictions.

When developing training datasets for accelerometer-based behavioural classification, ground-truth labels are generally applied by time-matching video recordings of the individual with the accelerometer data and categorising the observed activities. How this is achieved
